# COMP0178-Project
Database Fundamentals Module Project - Auctions website.

Most of the code from "Views" provided by the course instructor.

### Notes

If it is the first time you are running the app, uncomment migrations in index.php; do keep in mind that this will delete any information in your current version of the DB, so only do this once!

In this app, migrations will also run a seeder with initial information for the website (database/seeder.php). If you want to avoid this behaviour, comment out the seeder in database/migrations.php.
